## Expertise

**Solidity** smart contracts for **EVM** chains:

Significant **DeFi** experience - dozens of audits (lending, bridges, staking, DEXes, yield farming, etc.).



**Rust** & **Go** infrastructure projects and their components - majority of 2025 spent here:

Several audits of purpose-built L1s and components of L2s like Optimism. Although with no findings, I audited Pectra hardfork of Ethereum itself as a language learning experience + to deepen my understanding of the EVM and the consensus layer.

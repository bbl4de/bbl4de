## Expertise

**I explore the design and implementation in-depth, then find bugs; the language and project type is secondary.**

➡️ I specialize in all **Solidity** smart contracts for **EVM** chains, as well as infrastructure projects and their components written in **Go** or **Rust**.

➡️ I have significant **DeFi** experience after auditing almost all types of protocols over the last year (lending, bridges, staking, DEXes, yield farming, etc.).

➡️ I reviewed several purpose-built L1s and components of L2s like Optimism and the Pectra hardfork of Ethereum itself.
